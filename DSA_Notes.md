#C++
C++ is a versatile language, and it relies on libraries to access various functionalities.
To perform tasks like input and output, we include specific libraries at the beginning of our code.
For instance, #include<iostream> is used for input and output operations, 
while #include<math.h> allows us to use mathematical functions. 
Simply put, libraries provide pre-built functions and tools for us to use in our code.

##The Generic Skeleton
#include<iostream>

int main() {
    // Your code here
    return 0;
}
